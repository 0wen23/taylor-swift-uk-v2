# Taylor Swift UK Store Scraper  

This Python script scrapes product data from the Taylor Swift UK store using public API endpoints. It fetches details like product names, sizes, stock availability, and links, then saves the data in JSON format.  

## Features  
- Scrapes multiple collection pages  
- Handles pagination automatically  
- Extracts product details (name, sizes, stock status, image, link)  
- Saves unique products to a JSON file  

You can then do what you wish with said json file and some modifications, can be used to monitor restocks or new products added to the website.
